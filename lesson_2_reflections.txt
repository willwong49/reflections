What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden .git folder containing the meta data regardings all the commits. Once initialised the folder can hold commits as a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

An intermediate state that allows you to assign files that should be included in the next commit. It allows you to organise your commits by splitting logical changes in the form of separate files.
